# Your project title

A short and fun introductory game, "Hello Unity"

## Technical setup instructions

Should work with Unity Hub with Unity 2020.3.x LTS

## Special controls 

No controls for now, just sit back and watch a crazy ball rolling around and changing colours (and maybe jumping out of the screen)
